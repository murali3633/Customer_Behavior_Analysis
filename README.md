An end-to-end **Data Analytics Project** focused on analyzing real-world customer shopping behavior using **Python, SQL, and Power BI**.

This project covers the complete analytics pipeline:   
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)   
- Business analysis using SQL 
- Interactive dashboard creation in Power BI 
 
---

## 📌 Project Objective   

To understand:
- How customers behave across product categories   
- The impact of discounts and subscriptions on revenue  
- Spending patterns across age groups and gender  
- The role of shipping methods in customer spending  

The goal is to convert raw data into **actionable business insights for decision-making**.
